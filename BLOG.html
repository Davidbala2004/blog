       <p><h3>
        Prices for products and services increase if there is an imbalance between supply and demand, when distribution costs, such as labour and raw materials, vary, or when any of these circumstances might result in an increase in taxes. The value of money is subsequently impacted, which has an effect on the currency. This is the reason why buying the same thing over time costs more money.</h3></p>

       <p><h3>
        When the prices of goods and services become dearer, you will have to shell out more which impacts your personal finances. Your income will need to be higher just to afford the same product and services in the future that you have been enjoying right now.

        Eating the same food but traveling to the same places and all the activities you enjoyed at the beginning of the year will get much more expensive towards the end of year thanks to inflation and this is the impact which inflation has on your life.</h3></p>

      <h1>How to Combat Inflation</h1>
       <p><h3>
        While inflation can wreak on day to day life, there are ways to protect yourself and your financially. The value of the rupee is currently falling and prices everywhere for all commodities and services are increasing.</h3></p>
        <p><h3>This is why experts advise individually  not to solely rely on schemes such as RD/FDs or park of the money in the savings account because the rate of interest is lesser than the rate of inflation. Most of us have been taught to save rather than invest due to the risks involved, but over time, savings will not help you get by.
        </h3></p>
        <p><h3>Options such as stocks and mutual funds should be considered and if you can afford it, real estate, gold and cryptocurrencies as well. While these options are definitely risky than traditional savings schemes, the ROI (Return On Investment) from such investments are higher than the traditional investments. Whereas most of the assets in the conventional practices depreciate over time on a long term.
        </h3></p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p><h3>The term inflation usually evokes some measure of fear and apprehension but if one knows how to stay ahead of  it, on a moderate level, it can be beneficial for the country as well as consumers. But out of the control , it can have a detrimental effect on your every day expenses.
